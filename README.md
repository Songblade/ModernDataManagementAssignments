# ModernDataManagementAssignments
This repository contains the assignments for the Modern Data Management class, a class exploring databases and ways of using data. Assignments were in SQL, Java, Python, and JavaScript (Node.js).

Assignment writeups are PDFs with the same name as the assignment, as was the professor's standard.

Of the assignments, SQL3 and PublicLibraries involved relational databases, Mongo1 and NodeAndMongo3 used MongoDB, RedisCache used Redis, ArtistsAndBands used both Redis and MongoDB, and FlavorsOfSpark used Apache Spark.
